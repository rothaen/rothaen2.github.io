    <h1>Welcome to my page for selling Coffee Mugs</h1>
    <p>Over the past 7 years I have been expanding my collection of Coffee Mugs to an impressive size.  Sadly it is time to sell
    them, because college is expensive.  I have Mugs for just about <b>every</b> state that you can think of.</p>
    <h2>I know what you're thinking! <i>Why would I want someone elses old Coffee Mugs?</i>  Well I can tell you why my collection is special</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>They have never been used, so they're still in their original boxes</li>
      <li>They are iconic designs that are not used on mugs today, they can add to the vinage appeal you like</li>
      <li>You could finish your collection of mugs are use it as a gift for someone else's collection</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Other Concerns?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4-5 colors of mugs from each state</li>
      <li>Even states like Hawaii and Alaska Included</li>
      <li>Well maintained boxes (dusted weekly)</li>
    </ul>
